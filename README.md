# ScreenshotApp

This WPF app helps you to take the screenshot by using either of the following way
-by clicking on Capture button
-by pressing Keyboard key P

We have designed the MainWindow.XAML and its code behind is in MainWindow.XAML.cs file 

To run the application:
1. Make sure you have created "AppScreenshorts" folder on your desktop. In this folder all the screenshot images will get saved
2. Once you create the "AppScreenshorts" folder , please take the full path of that folder and add in our code
3. In MainWindow.xaml.cs file, update the folder path in bitmap_Screen.Save() method.Replace the path 
"C:\\Users\\manasi\\Desktop\\AppScreenshorts\\" 
4. You can run the application.
